# Getting and Cleanig Data Project by Coursera

Enrique R. Perezyera Benoit
Repository containing the data for submission in the course: Getting and Cleaning Data of the Data Science track by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

##Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

##Make Your Own Modifications to The Script!
Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files and stored the run_analysis.R file in the same directory, you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data, wich is setting up the working directory. Since you have come this far I assume that you are no idiot and therefore have fun reading it.
For those who are doing the projects, I hope that the file helps you understand each step of the process.

##Project Summary

The R script should do the following:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to describe the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Additional Info
You can find more details and information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
